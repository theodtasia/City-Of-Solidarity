                    In this team effort, to reduce the rates of poverty in our country, as well as its serious effects
                    on our
                    society, it is necessary to be fully aware of the real situation. Only in this way will we be able
                    to prioritize
                    our struggle to combat this phenomenon, which also affects our city. Following, there is a
                    presentation of data
                    on the state of poverty in our country, which have been recorded since the beginning of the economic
                    crisis. The
                    following data comes from the Income Research and Living Conditions of the Houses of the Hellenic
                    Statistical
                    Authority (ELSTAT) published in 2020, while including measurements for the previous 12 years.

                            According to this definition, the "poverty risk threshold" is created, which changes
                            dynamically depending

                    The first graph shows the change in the price of the poverty line from 2011 until today. The amount
                    of money is
                    in unit â‚¬ and concerns annual household income with two adults and two dependent members (children)
                    under 14
                    years of age. This chart shows that in times of economic crisis, the average family is called upon
                    to live on a
                    fairly low income.

                    The following is a presentation of the data on the percentage of our fellow citizens living on the
                    brink of
                    poverty in the last decade.</p>

                    The statistical survey for the year 2019 showed that 16.2% of the general population of our country
                    has material
                    deprivation. This percentage reflects both the poor and the non-poor. Therefore, both percentages
                    face
                    difficulties in their survival. But at this point, we need to take a closer look at the needs that
                    most concern
                    families. The following bar chart includes the percentages of households of the poor population that
                    are unable
                    to meet certain needs, as well as those needs.

                    Of course, there are other difficulties that greek households face in large percentages, such as the
                    inability
                    to cover personal expenses (eg a hobby) or participation in leisure activities (eg a meeting with
                    friends /
                    relatives for food). or drink), or even inability to connect to the internet.</p>
