<p class = "text-justify"> Due to the difficult economic situation prevailing in Greece in recent years, most charities are faced daily with many different problems.
  These problems arise mainly due to the lack of the necessary equipment, but also the appropriate staff, for their staffing. <br> <br> <div class="row">
              <div class="shadow-box-example2">
				  <div class="text-center">
                     <h1>help</h1>

			 <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top: 70px"> 

According to statistics, almost 2,300,000 people in Greece today live below the poverty line, making it difficult for them to meet their basic needs. One of them is their need for medical care. The paradox is that at the same time, about 34,000,000 medicine boxes are not used every year, they run out and end up in the trash. In other words, on the one hand, there is an inability to buy / find drugs in a large portion of the population, while on the other hand, it is a fact that a huge amount of drugs remains unused every year.
</p>
<p class = "text-justify"> Particularly vulnerable groups have increased needs for medicines and equipment, which are often not adequately covered or covered. For this reason, institutions that care for and care for the elderly, people with disabilities and mobility or mental health problems, make frequent appeals for help to all, due to the inadequacy of medical equipment (medicines, antiseptics, masks, soaps, diapers) and food.
</p>
<p class = "text-justify"> Of course, the problems faced by child protection institutions are similar. In addition to shortages in the institutions, there are major inequalities in the education and entertainment of these children. It is a given that in order for all children to develop healthy and complete personalities, it is necessary for them to have free access to books, school equipment and toys.
</p>
                <p class = "text-justify">
                   Another issue that is often of concern is both the numerical and the qualitative adequacy of staffing the institutions. This issue is very serious and concerns most child protection institutions.
In particular, the Ombudsman has found:
<ul>
                        <li> Inadequate staffing of the vast majority of public and private sector institutions, which has been exacerbated by the current economic situation and the inability to hire specialized personnel. <br>
    
<li> Absence or complete absence of scientific staff and lack of provision for training of unskilled staff.
It is a fact that many institutions do not have any social workers, while in many cases employees do not receive any training or education regarding the care and needs of vulnerable children. </li>
</ul>
               <p class = "text-justify">
                  Consequently, the intervention of active citizens in society is considered necessary. Voluntary activities such as gathering food and equipment, visiting institutions for care, discussion, companionship with children and the elderly, and reorganizing the community's indoor and outdoor facilities help keep them running smoothly. On our website, you can be informed about the needs of the organizations in our area, but also about voluntary actions that are organized.
